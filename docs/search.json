Further information on how to access this data can be found here: https://docs.ropensci.org/stats19/index.html\nAfter collecting the data, I used web scrapping to find the postcode of each driving test centre. I then used GeoPy to extract the latitude and longitude from the postcodes. I mapped the coordinates of each accident to the coordinates of the nearest driving centre using the haversine formula:\n\\[\n  haversin\\left(\\frac{d}{r}\\right) = haversin\\left(\\phi_{1} - \\phi_{2}\\right) + cos\\left(\\phi_{1}\\right)cos\\left(\\phi_{2}\\right)haversin\\left(\\lambda_{1} - \\lambda_{2}\\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(r\\) is the radius of the earth, \\(d\\) is the distance between two points, \\(\\phi_{1}, \\phi_{2}\\) are the latitudes of the two points and \\(\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2}\\) are the longitudes of the two points.\nLet’s load the data and see what information we have!\n\n\nCode\ndata = pd.read_csv('crashes_merged_2017_to_2020.csv', engine='pyarrow', encoding='ISO-8859-1')\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata.head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naccident_index\naccident_year\naccident_severity\nnumber_of_vehicles\nnumber_of_casualties\nnearest_test_centre\n2020_passrate\n2019_passrate\n2018_passrate\n2017_passrate\n2020_conducted\n2019_conducted\n2018_conducted\n2017_conducted\n\n\n\n\n0\n2.017010e+12\n2017\nFatal\n2\n3\nTottenham\n43.046875\n39.634783\n37.53915\n37.65838824\n1280\n5750.0\n4470.0\n3946\n\n\n1\n2.017010e+12\n2017\nSlight\n2\n1\nTottenham\n43.046875\n39.634783\n37.53915\n37.65838824\n1280\n5750.0\n4470.0\n3946\n\n\n2\n2.017010e+12\n2017\nSlight\n2\n4\nTottenham\n43.046875\n39.634783\n37.53915\n37.65838824\n1280\n5750.0\n4470.0\n3946\n\n\n3\n2.017010e+12\n2017\nSlight\n2\n1\nTottenham\n43.046875\n39.634783\n37.53915\n37.65838824\n1280\n5750.0\n4470.0\n3946\n\n\n4\n2.017010e+12\n2017\nSlight\n2\n1\nTottenham\n43.046875\n39.634783\n37.53915\n37.65838824\n1280\n5750.0\n4470.0\n3946\n\n\n5\n2.017010e+12\n2017\nSlight\n2\n1\nTottenham\n43.046875\n39.634783\n37.53915\n37.65838824\n1280\n5750.0\n4470.0\n3946\n\n\n6\n2.017010e+12\n2017\nSlight\n1\n1\nTottenham\n43.046875\n39.634783\n37.53915\n37.65838824\n1280\n5750.0\n4470.0\n3946\n\n\n7\n2.017010e+12\n2017\nSlight\n2\n1\nTottenham\n43.046875\n39.634783\n37.53915\n37.65838824\n1280\n5750.0\n4470.0\n3946\n\n\n8\n2.017010e+12\n2017\nSlight\n1\n1\nTottenham\n43.046875\n39.634783\n37.53915\n37.65838824\n1280\n5750.0\n4470.0\n3946\n\n\n9\n2.017010e+12\n2017\nSlight\n2\n1\nTottenham\n43.046875\n39.634783\n37.53915\n37.65838824\n1280\n5750.0\n4470.0\n3946\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each accident, we have accident_severity: the severity of the accident - Slight, Serious or Fatal.

Next, we will plot the average driving test pass rate and the average number of accidents over the observed period.\n\n\nCode\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, sharex=True)\nsns.lineplot(data = (data\n                     .groupby('nearest_test_centre')\n                     .mean()[['2020_passrate', '2019_passrate', '2018_passrate', '2017_passrate']]\n                     .rename(columns={'2017_passrate':2017, '2018_passrate':2018, '2019_passrate':2019, '2020_passrate':2020})\n                     .melt(var_name='Year', value_name='Pass Rate', ignore_index=False)\n                     .reset_index(drop=False)),\n             x = 'Year',\n             y = 'Pass Rate',\n             ax=ax1\n             )\nsns.lineplot(data = data.groupby('accident_year')['accident_index'].count(), ax=ax2)\nax1.title.set_text('Average driving test pass rate')\nax2.title.set_text('Average number of accidents')\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the first plot, The pass rates of driving tests from 2017 to 2019 remained relatively stable, ranging from 48.88% to 49.33%. However, there was a noticeable increase in the pass rate to 53.23% in 2020. Similarly, the second plot shows a general decreasing trend in accident rates between 2017 and 2019, with a larger decrease 2020. This spike in pass rates and a significant drop in accident rates could be due to various reasons, such as improved driving habits, improved road safety measures, or even the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on testing and driving patterns. It is not conclusive at this stage if there is a direct association between the two results.\nWe will now create a new feature, passrate, that combines the four pass rate columns.\n\n\nCode\ndata['passrate'] = (data[['2017_passrate', '2018_passrate','2019_passrate','2020_passrate']]\n                     .values[np.where(data['accident_year']\n                                      .values.reshape(-1,1) == [2017,2018,2019,2020])])\n\n\nGrouping the data by nearest_driving_test_centre and accident_year.\n\n\nCode\ngrouped_df = (data\n              .assign(slight_accident = data['accident_severity'] == 'Slight')\n              .assign(serious_accident = data['accident_severity'] == 'Serious')\n              .assign(fatal_accident = data['accident_severity'] == 'Fatal')\n              .groupby(['nearest_test_centre', 'accident_year']).agg(\n                  passrate=('passrate', np.mean),\n                  number_of_accidents=('nearest_test_centre', 'count'),\n                  number_of_slight_accidents=('slight_accident', np.sum),\n                  number_of_serious_accidents=('serious_accident', np.sum),\n                  number_of_fatal_accidents=('fatal_accident', np.sum))\n              .reset_index(drop=False)\n              )\n\n\nWe can now plot the distribution of the driving test pass rates, highlighting the year the test took place.\n\n\nCode\nsns.histplot(data = grouped_df, x='passrate', hue='accident_year')\n\n\n&lt;AxesSubplot:xlabel='passrate', ylabel='Count'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram reinforces the conclusions seen earlier, the pass rates for 2017 to 2019 have a roughly similar shape. Whereas the pass rates for 2020 are more right-skewed. The mean pass rate over all 4 years is 50.0976998216524%\n\n\nCode\nsns.histplot(data = grouped_df, x='number_of_accidents', hue='accident_year')\n\n\n&lt;AxesSubplot:xlabel='number_of_accidents', ylabel='Count'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histogram shows that the number of accidents per year is highly right-skewed for all 4 years. The mean number of accidents per year is 373.5821917808219. There appear to be many test centres with 0 or close to 0 accidents a year. To investigate this further, we will look at the test centres with extreme values for both the number of accidents and the pass rates.\nLooking first at test centres with the lowest number of accidents and the highest pass rates.\n\n\nCode\ngrouped_df.sort_values(['number_of_accidents', 'passrate'], ascending = [True, False]).head(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnearest_test_centre\naccident_year\npassrate\nnumber_of_accidents\nnumber_of_slight_accidents\nnumber_of_serious_accidents\nnumber_of_fatal_accidents\n\n\n\n\n219\nBuckie\n2020\n54.545455\n4\n1\n2\n1\n\n\n247\nCampbeltown\n2020\n76.470588\n7\n4\n2\n1\n\n\n246\nCampbeltown\n2019\n73.684211\n7\n4\n3\n0\n\n\n217\nBuckie\n2018\n57.094595\n7\n2\n3\n2\n\n\n703\nLochgilphead\n2020\n74.074074\n8\n4\n2\n2\n\n\n479\nGolspie\n2020\n73.333333\n8\n6\n2\n0\n\n\n1019\nStranraer\n2020\n67.500000\n8\n5\n3\n0\n\n\n1015\nStornoway\n2020\n65.591398\n8\n5\n2\n1\n\n\n459\nGirvan\n2020\n63.636364\n8\n4\n4\n0\n\n\n375\nDunoon\n2020\n62.745098\n8\n5\n2\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, the test centres with the lowest number of accidents are in areas that have low population sizes.

We can also see that there appears to be greater volatility in the number of accidents for the lower pass rate test centres. There also appear to be some noticeable outliers, test centres that have a high number of accidents.\nTo further investigate the relationship, we will calculate the correlation matrix.\n\n\nCode\nmask = np.triu(np.ones_like(grouped_df.corr(method='kendall'), dtype=bool))\ncmap = sns.diverging_palette(230, 20, as_cmap=True)\nsns.heatmap(grouped_df.corr(), mask=mask, cmap=cmap, vmax=.3, center=0,\n            square=True, linewidths=.5, cbar_kws={\"shrink\": .5}, annot=True)\n\n\n&lt;AxesSubplot:&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis matrix shows that there is evidence of a weak to moderate negative relationship between the pass rate and the number of accidents. This relationship is also consistent over the accident types, with the number of fatal accidents having the lowest correlation with pass rate. Earlier we proposed that the trend of pass rates increasing and accident numbers decreasing in 2020 was due to the driving restrictions in place during the Covid-19 pandemic. Does this hidden effect add uncertainty to these values? We will remove the year 2020 from the dataset and recalculate the correlation matrix.\n\n\nCode\nmask = np.triu(np.ones_like(grouped_df[grouped_df['accident_year'] &lt; 2020].corr(method='kendall'), dtype=bool))\ncmap = sns.diverging_palette(230, 20, as_cmap=True)\nsns.heatmap(grouped_df[grouped_df['accident_year'] &lt; 2020].corr(), mask=mask, cmap=cmap, vmax=.3, center=0,\n            square=True, linewidths=.5, cbar_kws={\"shrink\": .5}, annot=True)\n\n\n&lt;AxesSubplot:&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThis matrix shows that the relationship is consistent before the pandemic.\nWe will now attempt to fit a linear regression model to investigate the relationship further.\n\n\nCode\nsns.regplot(x = 'passrate', y = 'number_of_accidents', data=grouped_df)\n\n\n&lt;AxesSubplot:xlabel='passrate', ylabel='number_of_accidents'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel_1 = smf.ols(formula='number_of_accidents ~ passrate + accident_year', data=grouped_df).fit()\nprint(model_1.summary())\n\n\n                             OLS Regression Results                            \n===============================================================================\nDep.

This might indicate that there are\nstrong multicollinearity or other numerical problems.\n\n\nThe adjusted R-squared value of 0.149 indicates that the model explains only 14.9% of the variance in the number_of_accidents.\nThe F-statistic of 103.4 and a p-value of 4.66e-42 indicate that the model as a whole is significant. This means that at least one of the independent variables in the model is significant in explaining the number_of_accidents.\nFor the individual independent variables, passrate has a t-statistic of -13.806 and a p-value of 0.000, indicating that it is significant in explaining the number_of_accidents. The accident_year variable has a t-statistic of -1.773 and a p-value of 0.076, indicating that it is not significant in explaining the number_of_accidents at the 5% significance level.\nThe coefficients of the regression indicate that for a 1 percent increase in passrate, the number_of_accidents decreases by 13.806 on average.\nThe Omnibus test has a p-value of 0.000, indicating that the residuals are not normally distributed. The Skew and Kurtosis values are also large and positive, indicating that the residuals are heavily skewed to the right and have a peaked distribution.\nThe condition number of 3.69e+06 is large, which indicates the presence of multicollinearity or other numerical problems. This could lead to unstable and unreliable regression coefficients and suggests that caution should be taken when interpreting the results.\n\n\nCode\npred_ols = model_1.get_prediction()\niv_l = pred_ols.summary_frame()[\"obs_ci_lower\"]\niv_u = pred_ols.summary_frame()[\"obs_ci_upper\"]\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16, 8))\n\nax.plot(grouped_df['nearest_test_centre'], grouped_df['number_of_accidents'], \"o\", label=\"data\")\nax.plot(grouped_df['nearest_test_centre'], model_1.fittedvalues, \"r--.\", label=\"OLS\")\nax.plot(grouped_df['nearest_test_centre'], iv_u, \"r--\")\nax.plot(grouped_df['nearest_test_centre'], iv_l, \"r--\")\nax.legend(loc=\"best\")\n\n\n&lt;matplotlib.legend.Legend at 0x1f802f52d40&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot of the observed values versus the fitted values with the confidence interval included shows that, for most test centres, the model fits the number_of_accidents between the confidence interval.

To attempt to mitigate this issue, we will use the number of driving tests conducted as a pseudo value for population size.\n\n\nCode\ndata['conducted'] = (data[['2017_conducted', '2018_conducted','2019_conducted','2020_conducted']]\n                     .values[np.where(data['accident_year']\n                                      .values.reshape(-1,1) == [2017,2018,2019,2020])])\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngrouped_df = (data\n              .assign(slight_accident = data['accident_severity'] == 'Slight')\n              .assign(serious_accident = data['accident_severity'] == 'Serious')\n              .assign(fatal_accident = data['accident_severity'] == 'Fatal')\n              .groupby(['nearest_test_centre', 'accident_year']).agg(\n                  passrate=('passrate', np.mean),\n                  conducted=('conducted', np.mean),\n                  number_of_accidents=('nearest_test_centre', 'count'),\n                  number_of_slight_accidents=('slight_accident', np.sum),\n                  number_of_serious_accidents=('serious_accident', np.sum),\n                  number_of_fatal_accidents=('fatal_accident', np.sum))\n              .reset_index(drop=False)\n              )\n\n\nWe divide the number of accidents by the number of tests conducted and multiply by 1000 to get the number of accidents per 1000 tests (or people).\n\n\nCode\ngrouped_df['accidents_adjusted'] = grouped_df['number_of_accidents']/grouped_df['conducted'] * 1000\ngrouped_df['slight_adjusted'] = grouped_df['number_of_slight_accidents']/grouped_df['conducted'] * 1000\ngrouped_df['serious_adjusted'] = grouped_df['number_of_serious_accidents']/grouped_df['conducted'] * 1000\ngrouped_df['fatal_adjusted'] = grouped_df['number_of_fatal_accidents']/grouped_df['conducted'] * 1000\n\ngrouped_df = grouped_df[['nearest_test_centre', 'passrate', 'accidents_adjusted', 'slight_adjusted', 'serious_adjusted', 'fatal_adjusted']]\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngrouped_2_df = (grouped_df\n                .groupby(['nearest_test_centre',]).agg(\n                    passrate=('passrate', np.mean),\n                    accidents_adjusted=('accidents_adjusted', np.mean),\n                    slight_adjusted=('slight_adjusted', np.mean),\n                    serious_adjusted=('serious_adjusted', np.mean),\n                    fatal_adjusted=('fatal_adjusted', np.mean))\n              .reset_index(drop=False)\n              )\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngrouped_2_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnearest_test_centre\npassrate\naccidents_adjusted\nslight_adjusted\nserious_adjusted\nfatal_adjusted\n\n\n\n\n0\nAberdeen North\n54.854631\n39.120405\n23.829155\n14.723623\n0.567628\n\n\n1\nAberdeen South (Cove)\n57.237618\n20.764980\n12.104572\n7.899692\n0.760715\n\n\n2\nAbergavenny\n58.753888\n36.992872\n24.321708\n11.431776\n1.239388\n\n\n3\nAberystwyth (Park Avenue)\n53.623044\n169.516180\n130.009211\n36.264133\n3.242836\n\n\n4\nAirdrie\n47.398923\n74.426218\n53.775133\n18.387963\n2.263122\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n287\nWorkington\n53.100607\n167.157629\n126.844385\n37.030612\n3.282632\n\n\n288\nWorksop\n55.829321\n106.139175\n74.833260\n28.565052\n2.740863\n\n\n289\nWrexham\n42.650556\n77.457255\n56.728892\n19.529580\n1.198783\n\n\n290\nYeovil\n62.411467\n98.353587\n81.594604\n14.977450\n1.781533\n\n\n291\nYork\n52.422700\n94.550250\n78.899257\n13.950239\n1.700754\n\n\n\n\n292 rows × 6 columns\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsns.regplot(x = 'passrate', y = 'accidents_adjusted', data=grouped_2_df)\n\n\n&lt;AxesSubplot:xlabel='passrate', ylabel='accidents_adjusted'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot of pass rate and adjusted accident rates now shows evidence of a positive linear association.

This is the opposite of the relationship shown in the first model. * The p-value for passrate is not significant at a significance level of 0.05, unlike the previous two models. * The high skewness and kurtosis values also suggest a non-normal distribution of residuals. This could indicate that there might be other variables or non-linear relationships not captured by the model. This is consistent with the previous two models.\n\n\nCode\npred_ols = model_3.get_prediction()\niv_l = pred_ols.summary_frame()[\"obs_ci_lower\"]\niv_u = pred_ols.summary_frame()[\"obs_ci_upper\"]\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(16, 8))\n\nax.plot(grouped_2_df['nearest_test_centre'], grouped_2_df['accidents_adjusted'], \"o\", label=\"data\")\nax.plot(grouped_2_df['nearest_test_centre'], model_3.fittedvalues, \"r--.\", label=\"OLS\")\nax.plot(grouped_2_df['nearest_test_centre'], iv_u, \"r--\")\nax.plot(grouped_2_df['nearest_test_centre'], iv_l, \"r--\")\nax.legend(loc=\"best\")\n\n\n&lt;matplotlib.legend.Legend at 0x1f8016c5e10&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfig = sm.graphics.influence_plot(model_3, criterion=\"cooks\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ngrouped_2_df[grouped_2_df['nearest_test_centre'] == grouped_2_df.iloc[275]['nearest_test_centre']]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnearest_test_centre\npassrate\naccidents_adjusted\nslight_adjusted\nserious_adjusted\nfatal_adjusted\n\n\n\n\n275\nWellingborough\n61.390541\n1165.93911\n855.6676\n275.021914\n35.249596\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe influence plot below highlights that the most influential outlier is the Wellingborough test centre. This test centre has an above average pass rate but extremely high number of accidents.\nAfter normalising for population size there no longer appears to be any evidence of an association between driving test pass rates and accident rates. We can show that the main driver of the effect shown in the first model was actually most likely the effect of differences in population size rather than the pass rate of the test centre.\n\n\nCode\ngrouped_df = (data\n              .assign(slight_accident = data['accident_severity'] == 'Slight')\n              .assign(serious_accident = data['accident_severity'] == 'Serious')\n              .assign(fatal_accident = data['accident_severity'] == 'Fatal')\n              .groupby(['nearest_test_centre', 'accident_year']).agg(\n                  passrate=('passrate', np.mean),\n                  conducted=('conducted', np.mean),\n                  number_of_accidents=('nearest_test_centre', 'count'),\n                  number_of_slight_accidents=('slight_accident', np.sum),\n                  number_of_serious_accidents=('serious_accident', np.sum),\n                  number_of_fatal_accidents=('fatal_accident', np.sum))\n              .reset_index(drop=False)\n              )\n\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharex=True, figsize=(16, 8))\n\nsns.scatterplot(data = grouped_df, x='conducted', y='passrate', hue='accident_year', ax=ax1)\nsns.scatterplot(data = grouped_df, x='conducted', y='number_of_accidents', hue='accident_year', ax=ax2)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first plot shows that as the number of test conducted increases; the pass rate decreases.
